# CDISC ODM as LinkML
CDISC is the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium

The purpose of the ODM (Operational Data Model) is to provide a model for clinical trial collection and processing activities

The purpose of LinkML is to bridge multiple different modelling languages

By expressing ODM as LinkML, clinical trial engineers and scientists can pick up the model directly as

* JSON Schema
* GraphQL
* SQL
* Excel
* RDF
* OWL
* Python dataclasses
* Pydantic
* JS/TS classes
* Markdown documentation on Github pages

The more people pick up and use ODM, the more FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) their clinical trial programming becomes
