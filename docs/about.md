# CDISC ODM as LinkML
CDISC is the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium

The purpose of the ODM (Operational Data Model) is to provide an extensible model with a comprehensive common core for clinical trial collection and processing.

The purpose of LinkML is to bridge multiple different modelling languages. By expressing ODM as LinkML, clinical trial engineers and scientists can pick up the model directly as schemata and classes

The more teams pick up, use, and exchange ODM; the more [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) their data handling becomes
